Function Borrowing
With the bind() method, an object can borrow a method from another object.

The example below creates 2 objects (person and member).


The member object borrows the fullname method from the person object:
*/

const empDetails = {
  firstname: "Shubham",
  lastname: "Sonar",
  fullName: function () {
    return (
      this.fname +
      " " +
      this.lname
    );

    // return this.fname + " " + this.lname + ' , ' + firstname + lastname;
    //  Here the firstname and lastname are undefined as it doesnot have the direct access.
    // Also not through this keyword because this can always refer to only one object.
    // therefore this.firstname and this.lastname will also be in accessible.
  },
};

const employee1 = {
  fname: "Bhushan",
  lname: "Gaikwad",
};

// While we use the call for method borrowing we directly call the method and get the result or 
//returned value from the function.
console.log(empDetails.fullName.call(employee1));

// While we use bind for method borrowing we get the new bound function. 
//In which the 'this' keyword will always refer to the borrowing object.
// Therefore we need to call the bound method explicitly using the paranthesis ().
console.log(empDetails.fullName.bind(employee1));

console.log(empDetails.fullName.bind(employee1)());

// syntax 1
let empName = empDetails.fullName.bind(employee1);
console.log(empName());

// syntax 2 = giving parenthesis after a full call x.y.z(emp1)();
console.log(empDetails.fullName.bind(employee1)());

/*
-----------------------Preserving this---------------------
Sometimes the bind() method has to be used to prevent loosing this.

In the following example, the person object has a display method. In the display method, 
this refers to the person object
*/

const person = {
  firstName: "Shubham",
  lastName: "Sonar",
  display: function () {
    let x = this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    return x;
  },
};

console.log(person.display());

/*
When a function is used as a callback, this is lost.

This example will try to display the person2 name after 3 seconds, but it will display undefined instead:
*/

const person2 = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  display: function () {
    let x = this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    return x;
  },
};
let xxx = setTimeout(person2.display, 3000);
console.log(xxx);



// In background the callback method is not able to find the value of this therefore we use the binding method.
// Below function will not run correctly because it is not called using the object. Called directly callback();
// In backgroud it will look as follows. Fake example

// function setTimeout(callback, miliseconds){
//   if(miliseconds === 0){
//     return callback(){
//     let x = this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
//     return x;
//   };
//   }
// }


// Below function will run correctly because we are using the bind method to bind the value of this.
// In backgroud it will look as follows. Fake example

// function setTimeout(callback, miliseconds){
//   if(miliseconds === 0){
//     return callback(){
//     let x = person2.firstName + " " + person2.lastName; // Because bound function is sent as a callback function.
//     return x;
//   };
//   }
// }



/*
            The bind() method solves this problem.

In the following example, the bind() method is used to bind person.display to person.
This example will display the person name after 3 seconds:
*/

const person3 = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  display: function (hobby) {
    let x = this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + hobby;
  },
};

let display = person3.display.bind(person3);

console.log(setTimeout(display, 3000));

// We can also do the binding while defining the method.

const person4 = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  displays: function () {
    let x = this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  },
  display: this.displays.bind(this),
};

let displays = person4.displays.bind(person4);
console.log(setTimeout(displays, 3000));

console.log(setTimeout(person4.display, 3000));
// Here only display is used. Which is the method that is binded and thus preserves the value of this when it is called.
